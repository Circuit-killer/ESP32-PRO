1. Cleared up the text on the schematics

2. C30(4.7pF/50V/±0.1pF/COG/C0402(Murata_Electronics/GRM1555C1H4R7BA01D)) cahanged to C30(2.4nH/±0.1nH/220mA/300mR/L0402(Murata_Electronics/LQP15MN2N4B02D)) and L5(2.4nH/±0.1nH/220mA/300mR/L0402(Murata_Electronics/LQP15MN2N4B02D)) changed to L5(4.7pF/50V/±0.1pF/COG/C0402(Murata_Electronics/GRM1555C1H4R7BA01D)). Meaning that C30 and L5 values and positions were swapped! The symbols are still not corrected in the schematic!!!

3. EXT1 and EXT2 were changed from NA(HN1x16) to NS(HN1x16).

4. The crypto device, i.e. U6 and its capacitor C40 are changed to NA! Not placed.

5. The PIC's RTC crystal changed from Q32.768KHz/12.5pF/20ppm/4P/SMD_8038 to Q32.768KHz/12.5pF/20ppm/2P/SMD_1206. The capacitors C15 and C16 remained 33pF/50V/5%/COG/C0402, i.e. unchanged! Note that the package is still not updated to the real 1206 package!!!
